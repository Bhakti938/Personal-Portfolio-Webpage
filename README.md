In this task, I created a portfolio website using only HTML and CSS, with no JavaScript involved. The goal was to design a clean, responsive, and professional webpage that introduces me, showcases my skills, and displays selected projects in a simple and effective manner.

The portfolio is a single-page layout divided into clear sections: a header with navigation, an "About Me" section, a skills list, a project showcase, and a contact area. Each section is accessible via anchor links in the navigation bar, allowing users to quickly scroll to the relevant content.

For the structure, I used semantic HTML5 elements like <header>, <nav>, <section>, and <footer> to maintain a logical and accessible layout. Content is organized using headings, paragraphs, images, and links — all marked up cleanly to ensure clarity and proper flow.

Styling is handled entirely through CSS. I used Flexbox and media queries to create a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes. The layout is mobile-friendly and easy to read, with appropriate spacing, consistent font styles, and a calm color palette. Visual elements like hover effects, background gradients, and box shadows are applied using only CSS to create a modern interface without scripting.

One of the key learning points from this task was the power of HTML and CSS in building complete, functional websites without needing interactivity from scripts. By focusing solely on layout and design, I improved my skills in CSS positioning, layout planning, color harmony, and typography.

The website is structured in a way that it can be expanded in the future with JavaScript or a backend, but even in its current form, it is professional and fully usable. It can be hosted on GitHub Pages or shared as a résumé link.

This project helped me understand how to structure code cleanly, how to present content effectively, and how to make a strong first impression through design. It also serves as a live demonstration of my frontend skills for recruiters, mentors, and collaborators.
